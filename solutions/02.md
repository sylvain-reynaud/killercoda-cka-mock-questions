`k get pc`
`vi pc.yml`

Add from https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/pod-priority-preemption/
```yaml
apiVersion: scheduling.k8s.io/v1
kind: PriorityClass
metadata:
  name: high-priority
value: 1000000
preemptionPolicy: Never
globalDefault: false
description: "This priority class will not cause other pods to be preempted."
```

`k apply -f pc.yml`

Now edit the deployment and add the priority class to the deployment:

`vi deployment.yaml`

Add the priority class to the deployment:

From the kubernetes docs:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx
  labels:
    env: test
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
    imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
  priorityClassName: high-priority
```

`priorityClassName: high-priority` must be added to template spec.
