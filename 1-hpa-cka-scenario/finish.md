# Scenario Complete: HorizontalPodAutoscaler Configuration

## What You Accomplished
You successfully configured a HorizontalPodAutoscaler with advanced scaling parameters,  including:

- **Basic HPA setup** with CPU-based scaling
- **Custom stabilization windows** for controlled scaling behavior  
- **Resource limits and scaling boundaries** following production best practices

## Key Learning Points
1. **API Versions**: autoscaling/v2 provides advanced features like stabilization windows 
2. **Resource Requests**: HPA requires CPU/memory requests on target pods 
3. **Metrics Server**: Essential component for resource-based autoscaling 
4. **Scaling Policies**: Fine-grained control over scaling behavior

## Real-World Applications
This configuration pattern is commonly used in production environments for:
- Web applications with variable traffic 
- API services requiring responsive scaling
- Cost optimization through automatic scaling down during low usage 

**Excellent work! This scenario covered a key CKA exam topic.**
